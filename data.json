Additionally, this technology can be used as a retrospective analysis tool to determine if fatigue was a cause of a past lost-time injury. Lastly, this technology can be used to validate whether a company’s scheduling had an impact on risk-mitigation. The principle benefit of this technology is the potential to reduce fatigue-related lost-time injuries. With an in-depth study and validated scientific data, a company should be able to provide their insurers with a report indicating improvements in safety and risk-mitigation based on scheduling and workload.

Companies can leverage this device to benefit from hands-free communication, image and video recording, on-demand knowledge, location-based data collection, and three-dimensional augmented reality. Any of these tools can aid a company in data automation and empower real-time analytics of a workforce.\nOne example of a safety application is combining the GPS location capabilities with the known danger areas on a worksite to increase awareness. When a user enters the “danger zone”, a simple notification can pop up and alert the user of required PPE (Personal Protective Equipment). The notification could ask the user if he or she would like to see the company’s procedures for that particular area of the site. This solution could be easily built in to the device and would be ideal for training purposes.\nOne example of a productivity application is using the GPS location capabilities with the camera and voice recording to automate field-data collection. When a user is doing routine data collection around the site, the device could be used as a tool for capturing the data and automatically uploading the information to the company’s system. This translates into faster analytics and improved efficiency.\nThe principle benefit of this technology is tough to define since there are so many applications that could offer a significant ROI. Like SmartPhones and tablets, the largest impact will come from the applications written by the development community or customized platforms that integrate with a company’s system.","price":{"href":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=electronics&keywords=Google+Glass&linkCode=ur2&tag=vandrwearadat-20","text":"$1,500.00 USD"},"release":"February 2013","index":94,"url":"http://vandrico.com/wearables/device/google-glass"},{"company":"GOQii Inc","image":{"alt":"","src":"http://vandrico.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/device.png?itok=4BhOq3Wv","text":""},"name":"GOQii","potential":"Collection and study of bodily data by the device can help prevent mental and physical health of wemployees.

An internal vibrator can act as an excellent way to get a workers attention even when they are distracted with other tasks.","price":{"href":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=electronics&keywords=SmartQ+Z-Watch&linkCode=ur2&tag=vandrwearadat-20","text":"$99.99

FAST was principally designed to mitigate risk. Combined with their wearble ReadiBand, companies can use fatigue analytics and data visualization to understand areas of risk and implement measures to improve operational safety. Additionally, this technology can be used as a retrospective analysis tool to determine if fatigue was a cause of a past lost-time injury. Lastly, this technology can be used to validate whether a company’s scheduling had an impact on risk-mitigation. The principle benefit of this technology is the potential to reduce fatigue-related lost-time injuries. With an in-depth study and validated scientific data, a company should be able to provide their insurers with a report indicating improvements in safety and risk-mitigation based on scheduling and workload.

When a user enters the “danger zone”, a simple notification can pop up and alert the user of required PPE (Personal Protective Equipment). The notification could ask the user if he or she would like to see the company’s procedures for that particular area of the site. This solution could be easily built in to the device and would be ideal for training purposes.\nOne example of a productivity application is using the GPS location capabilities with the camera and voice recording to automate field-data collection. When a user is doing routine data collection around the site, the device could be used as a tool for capturing the data and automatically uploading the information to the company’s system. This translates into faster analytics and improved efficiency.\nThe principle benefit of this technology is tough to define since there are so many applications that could offer a significant ROI.
